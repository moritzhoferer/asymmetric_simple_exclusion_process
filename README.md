# Asymmetric simple exclusion process

The repository contains code for simulations of the *Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process* with different dynamics. For an introduction, I recommend reading the chapter 4 of Krapivsky, Pavel L., Sidney Redner, and Eli Ben-Naim, [A kinetic view of statistical physics](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511780516), Cambridge University Press, 2010 or this too short [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_simple_exclusion_process) article. The basic dynamics are regular hopping and pushing through nearest-neighbor interaction in both directions. Also, on and off dynamics are included as well as a open and periodic boundary conditions. There are to programs: (i) *single* to simulate steady-state dynamics and (ii) *ensemble* to have a look on equilibration dynamics of density steps in the initial state of the system. 

This is the code I wrote for my research project *RASEP: Repelling asymmetric exclusion process* in the group of Erwin Frey at LMU Munich. The project was supervise by Erwin Frey and Emanuel Reithmann. I conducted the project from August 2015 until January 2016. A short summary of the research project is given [here](https://sites.google.com/view/hoferer/research/biophysics#h.p_T1anLQ37QUzj).
