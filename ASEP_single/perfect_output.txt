# Simulation of a system with the following properties and parameters:
#
# System configuration
# System size:					10
# Boundary conditions:			open/periodic
# Start with empty system:		yes/no
# Initial spatial density:		0.4
# Final spatial density:		0.4
#
# Particle properties
# Rates of the different actions:
# Hop right:					0
# Hop right:					1
# Been pushed:					0
# Been repelled:				1
# Attach:						0
# Detach:						0
# Enter from the left:			0
# Leave at the left:			1
# Enter from the right:			1
# Leave at the right:			0
#
# Simulation time t =			t_now /t_max
# Recording starts at t = 		t_first/t_min
# Number of simulated steps:	step_count
# Trigger of truncation:		t_max/iteration_max reached/no more possible actions
# Recorded quantities:			density, current
